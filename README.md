# Reading-Quiz1
This is a reading comprehension quiz that I am trying to build for a catholic school, where my mom teaches 5th, 6th, and 7th grade reading.  I am trying to figure out how to give a score for the quiz in the Score method. Once I figure it out I will update it. Also, the questions that I have in there now are just random to test the code.
